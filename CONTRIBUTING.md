# Contributing

:balloon: Thanks for your help improving the project!

All contributions are welcome! No contribution is too small and all contributions are valued. However, it is important to first understand the scope of this list. Any project listed here should be a *direct* alternative or complement to a common unix command. If that is the case, then please [open a pull request](https://github.com/ibraheemdev/modern-unix/compare) or [a new issue](https://github.com/ibraheemdev/modern-unix/issues/new). Otherwise, you can submit your project to a more general list such as [awesome-shell](https://github.com/alebcay/awesome-shell) or [awesome-cli-apps](https://github.com/agarrharr/awesome-cli-apps). Thanks!
